You are on the first floor of the Robarts Library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily quiet.
Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands near the

Bahen

You are at the bahen building, a hub for engineering, computer science, and math students. Towards the entrance, you see a poster promoting an AI conference taking part at 2:41 AM tomorrow.
