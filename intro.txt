You've got a big exam tonight, and you've been hitting the books for weeks. 
But last night was a bit of a mess. You were all over campus, trying to study, 
but ended up misplacing some important stuff: your T-card, lucky exam pen, and cheat sheet. 
Without them, you're feeling pretty anxious about getting into the exam and doing your best. 
Can you track them down before the exam starts?
